      <description>Lauralee would like to go on a trip to Seoul sometime, and I was at Freeman&#39;s with Jess and Craig, and they were talking about a trip to visit Kyle sometime. I decided to start learning a bit of Korean now, and see how functional I can get it by then.I&#39;ve been at it for about a month now, and so far I feel like it&#39;s been my most efficient language learning venture so far!</description>

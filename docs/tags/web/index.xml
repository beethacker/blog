      <description>I haven&#39;t written anything for this blog in a while, so I forget how it was working. Maybe I should further document my process! It occurs to me that I have a few posts about this blog, but nothing seriously describing what it is or how it works! I also forget my password.  Entries are written in HTML with a few meta tags at the top. These can then be FTP&#39;d to the server.</description>

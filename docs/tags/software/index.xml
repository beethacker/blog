      <description>This week I&#39;ve been working on yet another new blog. It feels a little silly, since I never manage to keep up with writing entries, but maybe this time will be different. It&#39;s also a very small enjoyable project that I can finish and cross off the list. The current version feels pretty similar to last time, but the trick is that this time I&#39;m statically generating the pages offline in C++.</description>

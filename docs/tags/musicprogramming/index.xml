      <description>At the beginning of the year, I had a really bad ear. I found it difficult if not impossible to learn to play things by ear. Any ear training that I&#39;d ever attempted felt difficult or fruitless. Now, I&#39;ve written software to generate music flash cards for myself, which I&#39;ve dubbed &#39;Owl&#39;, and have embarked on a new ear training regime. So far it feels incredibly enjoyable and productive!  Motivation  When learning a language one school of thought is to, rather than relying on learning list of grammar rules, is to just learn a lot of sentences.</description>

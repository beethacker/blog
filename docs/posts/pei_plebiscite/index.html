<meta name="description" content="In thinking about the results of the plebiscite, it's important to keep in mind how alternative vote works and how it's unfair."/>

<p>In the recent PEI plebiscite MMP was selected as the "winner" using an alternative vote. First Past the Post received the most first choice votes, so in some sense (plurality), it's the "winner". That's clearly an unfair system, but the alternative vote, which chose MMP, isn't necessarily a fair system either! </p>

<p>The total number of votes for MMP and DMP combined - votes for a proportional system - clearly beat FPTP. This was a big win for proportional representation, and we see this in the final result as MMP coming out over top of FPTP.</p>

<p> I think it's important to consider what tallying the votes in this way does. Note that the FPTP votes never get redistributed. This means that the final results don't take into account the preference which FPTP voters might have on what kind of proportional system is best. It's quite possible that a majority of FPTP supporters would choose DMP above MMP. If about 61% of FPTP would rank DMP higher, then that would push DMP ahead of MMP. As I understand, DMP was intended to be more favourable than MMP for fans of the current system, so 61% doesn't seem unreasonable to me.
</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe the plebiscite is a win for proportional over FPTP.</li>
<li>I believe the plebiscite is a win for MMP over FPTP.</li>
<li>I <b>do not believe</b> that this was necessarily a win for MMP over DMP.</li>
</ul>

<p> I'd be really interested to see how the ballots compare DMP vs MMP. Maybe it was actually a win for MMP outright. Is there more data somewhere that I can look at? </p>

<p> Should there be further discussion and engagement about what proportional representation should look like on PEI? That seems reasonable. On the other hand, citing the voter turnout as a reason to halt moving forward with proportional is maddening. </p>

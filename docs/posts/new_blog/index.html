<p>
It's that time again. Every so often, I feel like I should keep a blog; sometimes I actually do it! A few times I've had word press set up, and other times I've hobbled things together myself. It's just nice to feel like I have a place where I can dump random things. 
</p>
<p>
The main <a href="http://www.cookwithchef.com"> CookWithChef  </a> page is now going to be a house Word Press blog. The old cook with chef site has moved to <a href="http://chef.cookwithchef.com"> chef.cookwithchef.com </a>!
</p>
<p> 
Meanwhile, I'm going to try to use this site as a personal blog! 
I had a simple rails blog for a while, which I rather enjoyed. My usual hosting doesn't include rails though, so it was hosted on a free openshift account. My account is still there, however the blog seems to have vanished! I don't think I've ever really been happy with my blog hosting situation. This time I'm just going to statically generate pages offline and ftp them up. We'll see how that goes.
I do have an exported xml version of my rails blog, as well as an old word press blog, so maybe I can eventually migrate those over here as well.

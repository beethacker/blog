Lauralee would like to go on a trip to Seoul sometime, and I was at Freeman's with Jess and Craig, and they were talking about a trip to visit Kyle sometime. 
I decided to start learning a bit of Korean now, and see how functional I can get it by then.

I've been at it for about a month now, and so far I feel like it's been my most efficient language learning venture so far! 
<a href="http://www.howtostudykorean.com/">http://www.howtostudykorean.com</a> is pretty fantastic! I really wish I had equivalents for French and Esperanto. What makes it great is that it's very easy to make anki cards. For each example sentence, there's a clickable link to the sound file, which can be dragged straight into anki. This doesn't sound like it should be so rare, but now that I've come to want content a certain way, it can get really annoying. Instead, I might be provided with one sound file for an entire dialog, or maybe one per word (not too bad), or maybe there's no way to drag and drop an mp3 link.

It might actually be <b>more</b>convenient than that! It provides memrise courses for its content, so maybe I could either just use those or import them into anki! (I should check out what else is on memrise in terms of French!) The import plugin is <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1959202519"> here </a>. It sounds like it's slightly broken, and needs to be patched using the updated source on its <a href=" https://github.com/wilddom/memrise2anki-extension "> github </a>

Full instructions are given in one comment <pre>
Thanks to all the previous comments I managed to get it to work with audio. I thought I'd write up how I installed it as in case helps anyone.

The following instructions were for a clean install of Anki version 2.0.32 on Windows 7.

1. In Anki, go to >tools >browse & install and enter the code 1959202519 then close Anki
2. Go to the folder C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE\Documents\Anki\addons directory and delete the folder Memrise_Course_Importer and the file MemriseCourseImporter.py
3. Go to github here https://github.com/wilddom/memrise2anki-extension and click the 'download zip' button and save the zip file to the desktop.
4. Extract the zip file to your desktop.
5. Copy the contents of the memrise2anki-extension-master folder to C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE\Documents\Anki\addons (you should end up with a folder called Memrise_Course_Importer in the addons with 2 other files MemriseCourseImporter.py and README.md.
6. Open anki and go to >tools >import memrise course and enter your memrise login details.
7. Then paste the link of the course you want to download (I used http://www.memrise.com/course/2086/the-450-most-common-french-verbs/ ) and select the relvant options from the dialogue (I left them at their default settings).
8. Wait for the files to download.
9. Under assign memrise fields leave the options as suggested

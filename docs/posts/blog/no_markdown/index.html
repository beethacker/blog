<p> Yesterday, I decided that it would be really nice if I could edit my posts in markdown. There are definitely some easy to find php libraries for parsing markdown, so I didn't think it would be too much work. This morning, however, integrating a library in seemed like it was going to be just a little too much busy work.</p>

<p>Instead, how good is sublime at editing HTML? I installed the Emmet plug in, which does some pretty cool stuff, but it's overkill. All I really had to do was add a handful of sublime snippets. </p>

<p>By default, p, b, i, etc will all expand to &ltp>&lt/p>, etc. The big ones I needed were to create the bulky meta tags used by the PHP scripts to generate the blog.</p>

<p> I also have snippets to expand h + tab to &lth1>title&lt/h1> and hh + tab to &lth2>title&lt/h2>. What would markdown really get for me? When there's just a lot of text in 'p' tags, html doesn't look super cluttered. All in all, I'm pretty happy with the editing situation. </p>

<p>
	This week I've been working on yet another new blog. It feels a little silly, since I never manage to keep up with writing entries, but maybe this time will be different. It's also a very small enjoyable project that I can finish and cross off the list. 
</p>

<p>
	The current version feels pretty similar to last time, but the trick is that this time I'm statically generating the pages offline in C++.

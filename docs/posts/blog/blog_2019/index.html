<p>Just like last year, I&rsquo;ve been getting that urge to start keep a blog again. This year, I&rsquo;ve managed to
clean up a few things with the process! I&rsquo;ve switched to using Hugo to generate a static site. It&rsquo;s a lot
more full featured than my hacked together generator in C. Switching to Hugo means that I&rsquo;ll have pagination
without having to write it myself. It also means that I can switch to using markdown to write posts! Hooray!</p>

<p>Oh wow! Cool, here we go! My first time writing a blog entry using vim!</p>

<h1 id="bye-bye-go-daddy">Bye Bye Go Daddy</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also switched over the <a href="http://bears.cookwithchef.com">bear blog</a> and <a href="http://chef.cookwithchef.com">Cook With Chef</a>
to being statically generated with Hugo. Now that they&rsquo;re just static sites, I can host them on <a href="http://pages.github.com">github.io</a>,
instead of GoDaddy. This means I can drop my GoDaddy account and save a couple bucks a year.</p>

<p>Good riddens! Having the GoDaddy account was a bit of a disaster. I wasted far too much time using php, since that&rsquo;s all that was available with
the cheapest hosting option. It looks like the offerings may have changed, and there&rsquo;s a chance that I could do rails now, but but I&rsquo;m so much happier with
the current solution.</p>

<p>I always found GoDaddy&rsquo;s web interface a bit of a pain. I could never find anything. I blew an entire afternoon trying to get cron jobs set up without so much as an email
giving me an error. Curiously, I started getting some errors a week or so later, and am still getting them to this day. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I deleted all the cron jobs though? Oh boy!</p>

<h1 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>I also have Robbie and Jess&rsquo;s raspberry pi right now, so if there&rsquo;s any really fancy server nonsense I want to test out, I can probably
just self host it off the pi. The only GoDaddy project that I have on the go right now that wouldn&rsquo;t work as a static web page, is the <a href="/posts/apps/projects_feb_2018/">Gumball Machine</a>, but that&rsquo;s currently broken anyway.</p>

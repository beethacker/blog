<p>Just like last year, I&rsquo;ve been getting that urge to start keep a blog again. This year, I&rsquo;ve managed to
clean up a few things with the process! I&rsquo;ve switched to using Hugo to generate a static site. It&rsquo;s a lot
more full featured than my hacked together generator in C.</p>

<p>Switching to Hugo means that I&rsquo;ll have pagination without having to write it myself. It also means that
I can switch to using markdown to write posts! Hooray!</p>

<p>Oh wow! Cool, here we go! My first time writing a blog entry using vim!</p>

<h1 id="bye-bye-go-daddy">Bye Bye Go Daddy</h1>

<p>A bigger change is that I&rsquo;m switching this blog, the <a href="http://bears.cookwithchef.com">bear blog</a>, and <a href="http://chef.cookwithchef.com">Cook With Chef</a>
to all be statically hosted through <a href="http://pages.github.com">github.io</a>. This means I can drop my GoDaddy account and save a couple bucks a year.</p>

<p>Good riddens! Having the GoDaddy account was a bit of a disaster. I wasted far too much time using php, since that&rsquo;s all that was available with
the cheapest hosting option.</p>

<h1 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>I also have Robbie and Jess&rsquo;s raspberry pi right now. That means if there&rsquo;s any really fancy server nonsense I want to test out, I can probably
just self host it off the pi.</p>

<p>The only GoDaddy project that I have on the go right now that wouldn&rsquo;t work as a static web page, is the <a href="/posts/apps/projects_feb_2018/">Gumball Machine</a>. This is currently broken anyway,
and using cron jobs on GoDaddy was a complete mess.</p>

I seem to be getting a whole lot done lately. I have a new <a href="/posts/blog/blog_2018">blog </a>system set up, and I've made a few silly websites for Lauralee. I've been playing with Android Studio and Unity! I've also gotten in the routine of reading and doing yoga!
</p>

<h1> Silly Websites </h1>

<h2> Webcomic Bubblegum Machine </h2>

<p>
	I made a website that dispenses comics for Lauralee.  Whenever I come across a comic that I think LL might like, I can upload it to the website. When she would like a little pick me up, she can get the website to randomly select a comic and redirect there.

<h2> Coupons </h2>

<p>
	We agreed not to exchange Christmas gifts this year, which was great! It just so happened that I thought of a fun gift. I had a lot of fun playing <a href="https://www.stepmania.com/">Step Mania</a> over the holidays, so I made a bunch of custom step files for songs that she likes. 
</p>

<p>
	I also made a simple website and gift card that could be redeemed on the website. I left out a few of the letters on the gift card, and hid these at the end of the Step Mania songs. 
</p>

<p>
	Once the code was entered in, this animated into this:

<p>
	and finally I delivered a physical version of the coupon. The coupon is good for getting me to go on one real big hike somewhere - probably Italy in 2019.

A couple of months ago, I decided that I would consider buying an ergonomic keyboard. The next week, I noticed a Facebook post about a synth instrument on Kickstarter.

This got me to thinking about using regular computer keyboards for playing synth. It's certainly never been a satisfying experience any time that I've tried it. Though,
what if a keyboard didn't have staggered rows? What if the keys were all layed out in a grid? Would that make it any nicer? Are there even keyboards 
like that?? Yes. Yes, there are!

Cool! This led me on a frantic bit of research on ergonomic keyboards. In particular, I started to notice a number of split keyboards.

These really appealed to me in an <a href="http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/split-keyboard/">ergonomic</a> sense! They allow for typing while keeping the arms 
in a much more neutral, relaxed position.By this point, I was starting to have a firm picture of what
I wanted. If I could only find an ergonomic split keyboard without staggered rows! This was a frustrating position to be in. 
There are a <b>lot</b> of images of these on the internet. It seems however, that the most common keyboard fitting this description is the Ergodox.

 Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, I don't think the ErgodoxEZ kickstarter was online yet! This would have meant waiting almost another year to get my hands on one. Typically, ergodox keyboards are sold through Massdrop as do it yourself kits. You need to solder all of the switches! I've never done any soldering; That sounds not only tedious but also very error prone. The only options for acquiring a assembled ergodox were to order on
 Ebay (only available with cherry MX red switches), or order from Falbatech in Poland. I ended up ordering from Falbatech and getting cherry brown switches. 
 </p>
<p>
The morning after I placed my order, I found this <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/70308014/kings-assembly-a-computer-mouse-full-of-awesome">kickstarter</a>, and wondered if I was missing out on an even more magical keyboard!! As of right now, I'm very glad that I went with ergodox. 
</p>
<p>
When I placed my order with Falbatech, they didn't give the option of buying keycaps. This led to a huge internet scavenger hunt trying to find somewhere that I could buy a set of keycaps that would fit the ergodox. At first I was picturing getting a keycap set for a standard keyboard, and just using the ones I needed. However, I'm not sure if that would give enough bigger modifier keys. After some hunting, I managed to find ergodox specific sets.
</p>
<p> 
One exciting perk of the ergodox is that the keyboard firmware is open source, and it runs on a Teensy board. This makes it amazingly configurable! When my order finally arrived, and I popped on all of the keycaps, I made a first attempt at compiling the firmware so I could put a custom layout on the keyboard. In trying to follow the instructions for assembling a new board, I got myself into a position where I was convinced that I completely wiped the firmware. 
</p>
<p>
Since I bought the ergodox assembled, I don't have access to the bootloader button on the teensy! The only way I have to get the teensy to run the bootloader, is by mapping a key in the firmware to run the bootloader. If I somehow wound up removing my firmware, or putting on firmware that doesn't provide access to the bootloader, then my ergodox would be completely useless. I was convinced that I was going to have to pry open my case and <i> hope </i> that I would have access to the button. There's an aluminum plate between my keys and the PCB, so maybe cracking open the case wouldn't even work! Maybe I just wasted hundreds of dollars on a keyboard that's completely bricked now. Ughhh!
</p>
<p>
Frustrated, I went downstairs, got something to eat, and when I came back, things were working fine.

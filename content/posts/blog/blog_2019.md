# Here We Go Again

Just like last year, I've been getting that urge to start keep a blog again. This year, I've managed to 
clean up a few things with the process! I've switched to using Hugo to generate a static site. It's a lot 
more full featured than my hacked together generator in C.

Switching to Hugo means that I'll have pagination without having to write it myself. It also means that
I can switch to using markdown to write posts! Hooray!

Oh wow! Cool, here we go! My first time writing a blog entry using vim! 

# Bye Bye Go Daddy

A bigger change is that I'm switching this blog, the [bear blog](http://bears.cookwithchef.com), and [Cook With Chef](http://chef.cookwithchef.com) 
to all be statically hosted through [github.io](http://pages.github.com). This means I can drop my GoDaddy account and save a couple bucks a year.

Good riddens! Having the GoDaddy account was a bit of a disaster. I wasted far too much time using php, since that's all that was available with
the cheapest hosting option. 

# Raspberry Pi

I also have Robbie and Jess's raspberry pi right now. That means if there's any really fancy server nonsense I want to test out, I can probably
just self host it off the pi.

The only GoDaddy project that I have on the go right now that wouldn't work as a static web page, is the [Gumball Machine](/posts/apps/projects_feb_2018/). This is currently broken anyway, 
and using cron jobs on GoDaddy was a complete mess.
